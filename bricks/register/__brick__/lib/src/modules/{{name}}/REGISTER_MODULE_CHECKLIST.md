## Additional Notes

### Current State
The registration module currently implements a multi-step flow:
1. Terms & Conditions acceptance
2. Phone number input with OTP verification
3. OTP confirmation
4. Password creation to complete registration

### Known Issues
- Password validation rules could be strengthened with more complex requirements
- Need to implement proper unit and widget tests
- Consider adding additional registration options (email, social media, etc.)

### Next Steps
1. Complete the test implementation
2. Enhance security features
3. Review and improve the user experience
4. Consider adding alternative registration methods
