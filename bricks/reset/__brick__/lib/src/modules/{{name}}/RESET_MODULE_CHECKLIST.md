## Task Assignments

| Task                                | Assigned To | Status      | Due Date    |
|-------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Complete unit tests                 | TBD         | Not Started | TBD         |
| Complete widget tests               | TBD         | Not Started | TBD         |
| Review reset flow UX                | TBD         | Not Started | TBD         |
| Add additional validation rules     | TBD         | Not Started | TBD         |

## Additional Notes

### Current State
The reset password module currently implements a two-step flow:
1. Phone number input with OTP verification (using OTP module)
2. Password creation to complete the reset process

### Known Issues
- Password validation rules could be strengthened with more complex requirements
- Need to implement proper unit and widget tests

### Next Steps
1. Complete the test implementation
2. Enhance security features
3. Review and improve the user experience
